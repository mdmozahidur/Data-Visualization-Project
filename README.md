# Data-Visualization-Project

Google Play Store, which is operated and developed by Google, is a digital sharing service that serves as official app 
store for the certified Android operating system users. It allows user to download and browse various application 
along with digital media. Google play store become one of the leading application for android over last 12 years 
which motivates me for further investigate. In this project I aimed to perform detail exploratory analysis on 
‘googleplaystore’ data set to predict different trends (app category/review/rating/installs/sales) of consumer 
market. I am also intend to find co-related apps those has most demand. Based on the exploratory analysis, this 
project aims to visualize forecast past selling trend. In conclusion, I could able to anticipate what type production 
strategies Google has followed to reach current position and weather there is any noticeable trend from audience 
within this timeline.
